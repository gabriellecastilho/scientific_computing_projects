# scientific_computing_projects
Scientific computing work from my Master's program at Uppsala University. Includes parallel numerical methods in C (LU factorization with OpenMP) and probabilistic modeling in Python (Markov chains for recommendation systems). Focus on performance and algorithmic implementation.
